                Hope's Peak Academy is home to Japan's best and brightest high school students — the beacons of hope
                for the future. But that hope suddenly dies when Makoto Naegi and his classmates find themselves
                imprisoned in the school, cut off from the outside world and subject to the whims of a strange,
                murderous little bear named Monokuma. He pits the students against each other, promising freedom to
                anyone who can murder a fellow classmate and get away with it.

                The game is from Hajime Hinata's point of view
                as he starts his first year at Hope's Peak Academy. As he walks into the school building, suddenly he
                blacks out
                he finds himself in a classroom full of his new classmates.
                They suddenly find themselves locked in the classroom, and a pink bunny, Usami, appears before them,
                claiming herself to be the class' teacher. The classroom around them soon falls away to reveal a
                paradise-like island. Usami tells them that they are on a school trip and that they are to befriend each
                other.

                your new friends to death. Forget what you thought you knew about Danganronpa and join a completely new
                cast of Ultimates for a brand-new beginning. In a world where everyone is trying to survive, nobody’s
                motivations are quite what they seem.
